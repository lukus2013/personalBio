        "Description": "This was the last vanilla javascript project we, my class, did before moving onto React. The class was given 2 hours to complete this project. The Api was already created, all we had to do was change the rules to what jokes were to be used. Styling wasn't the main focus, but burning through our knowledge quickly to create MVP. I didnt get to styling, it was a stretch goal, but I did complete the project within the time limit. No project page was created for this app.",
